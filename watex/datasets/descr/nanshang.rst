Nanshang data is collected during the Nashang project from 2018 to 2019. The type of drilling performed in this 
dataset in hydrogeological drilling. Indeed, Nanshang project aim goal was to predict the 
the probable land subsidence from 2024 to 2035 using many other influencal factors that encompasses the
InSAR data, the highways map, the distance to read, rivers ( Pearl rives etc ).
