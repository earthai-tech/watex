Some customized type variables  need to be explained for easy understanding 
in the whole package. Indeed, customized type hints is used to define the 
type of arguments. 

**M**: Suppose to be the interger variable `IntVar` to denote the number of 
    rows in the ``Array``. 
    
**N**: Like the ``M``, *N* means the number of column in the ``Array``. It 
    is bound with  integer variable. 
    
**T**: Is known as generic type standing for `Any` type of variable. We keep 
    it unchanged. 

**U**: Unlike `T`, `U` stands for nothing. Use to sepcify the one dimentional 
    array. For instance:: 
        
        >>> import numpy as np 
        >>> array = np.arange(4).shape 
        ... (4, )
        
**S**: Indicates the `Shape` status. It is bound by `M`, `U`, `N`. 'U' stands
    for nothing for one dimensional array. While, the common shape expects 
    for one of two dimensional arrays, it is possible to extend array for 
    more than one dimensional. The class object :class:`AddShape` is 
    created to grand all the remaining value of integers shape. 
    
**D**: Stands for  dtype object. It is bound with  :class:`DType`.

**Array**: Defined for  one dimensional array and `DType` can be specify. For 
    instance, we generated two arrays (`arr1`and `arr2`) for different types:: 
        
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from watex.typing import TypeVar, Array, DType
        >>> T = TypeVar ('T', float) 
        >>> A = TypeVar ('A', str, bytes )
        >>> arr1:Array[T, DType[T]] = np.arange(21) # dtype ='float'
        >>> arr2: Array[A, DType[A]] = arr1.astype ('str') # dtype ='str'
        
**NDArray**: Stands for multi-dimensional arrays i.e more than two. Here, the 
    difference between the one dimensional type variable ``Array`` is that 
    while the latter accepts the ``DType`` argument  as the second parameter. 
    It could be turn to the number of multidimentional rows including the 
    `Array as first argument and specify the DType as the second argument 
    like this:: 
        
        >>> import numpy as np 
        >>> from watex.typing import TypeVar, Array, NDarray, DType 
        >>> T =TypeVar ('T', int)
        >>> U = TypeVar ('U')
        >>> multidarray = np.arange(7, 7).astype (np.int32)
        >>> def accept_multid(
                arrays: NDArray[Array[T, U], DType [T]]= multidarray
                ):
            ''' asserted with MyPy and work-fine.'''
                ...
                
**Sub**: Stands for subset. Indeed, the class is created to define the 
    conductive zone. It is a subset ``Sub`` of ``Array``. For example, we first 
    build an array secondly extract the conductive zone from |ERP| line.
    Finally, we checked the type hint to assert whether the extracted zone 
    is a subset of the whole |ERP| line. The demo is given below:: 
        
        >>> import numpy as np 
        >>> from watex.typing import TypeVar, DType, Array , Sub
        >>> from watex.utils.exmath import _define_conductive_zone
        >>> T= TypeVar ('T', float)
        >>> erp_array: Array[T, DType[T]] = np.random.randn (21) # whole line 
        >>> select_zone, _ = _define_conductive_zone (erp = erp_array , auto =True)
        >>> select_zone: Array[T, DType[T]]
        >>> def check_cz (select_zone: Sub[Array]): 
                ''' assert with MyPy and return ``True`` as it works fine. '''
                ... 
                
**SP**: Stands for Station positions. The unit of position may vary, however, 
    we keep for :mod:`watex.method.electrical.ElectricalResistivityProfiling`
    the default unit in ``meters`` by starting at position 0. Typically,
    positions are recording according to the dipole length. For the example, 
    we can generated a position values for ``121 stations`` with dipole 
    length equals to ``50m`` i.e the length of the survey line is ``6 km``. 
    Here we go: 
        
        * Import required modules and generate the whole survey line::
            
            >>> import numpy as np 
            >>> from watex.typing import TypeVar, DType, SP, Sub 
            >>> T =TypeVar ('T', bound =int)
            >>> surveyL:SP = np.arange(0, 50 *121 , 50.).astype (np.int32)
            ... (work fine with MyPy )
            
        * Let's verify whether the extract data from surveyL is also a subset 
            of station positions:
                
            -  We use the following fonction to to extract the specific
                part of whole survey line `surveyL`:: 
                    
                    >>> from watex.utils.exmath import define_conductive_zone
                    >>> subpos,_ = define_conductive_zone (surveyL, s='S10') 
                    
            -  Now, we check the instance value `subpos` as subset array of 
                of `SP`. Note that the station 'S10' is included in the 
                extracted locations and is extented for seven points. For 
                further details, refer to `define_conductive_zone.__doc__`:: 
                
                    >>> def checksup_type (sp: Sub[SP[T, DType[T]]] = subpos ): 
                            ''' SP is an array of positions argument `sp`  
                            shoud be asserted as a subestof the whole line.'''
                            ... 
                    ... (test verified. subpos is a subset of `SP`) 
                    
**Series**: Stands for `pandas Series`_ object rather than using the specific 
    ``pandas.Series`` everywhere in the package. 
    
**DataFrame**: Likewise the ``Series`` generic type hint, it stands for 
    ``pandas DataFrame`_ object. It used to replace ``pandas.DataFrame`` object
    to identify the callable arguments in the whole packages. 
    Both can be instanciated as below:: 
        
        >>> import numpy as np 
        >>> import pandas pd 
        >>> from watex.typing import TypeVar , Any, DType , Series, DataFrame
        >>> T  =TypeVar('T')
        >>> seriesStr = pd.Series ([f'obx{s}' for s in range(21)],
                                 name ='stringobj')
        >>> seriesFloat = pd.Series (np.arange(7).astype(np.float32),
                                 name =floatobj)
        >>> SERs = Series [DType[str]] # pass 
        >>> SERf =Series [DType [float]] # pass 
    
        ..
    
        >>> dfStr= pd.DataFrame {'ser1':seriesStr , 
                            'obj2': [f'none' for i in range (21)]}
        >>> dfFloat= pd.DataFrame {'ser1':seriesFloat , 
                            'obj2': np.linspace (3, 28 , 7)}
        >>> dfAny= pd.DataFrame {'ser1':seriesStr, 
                            'ser2':seriesFloat}
        >>> DFs  = DataFrame [SERs] | DataFrame [DType[str]]
        >>> DFf  = DataFrame [SERf] | DataFrame [DType[float]]
        >>> DFa =  DataFrame [Series[Any]] | DataFrame [DType[T]]
 
**EDIO**: Stands for Electrical Data Interchange (EDI) Object. It is an object 
    built from `pycsamt`_ or `MTpy`_ packages. It holds 'T' or str as type 
    variables supposed to be an object created from the aforementioned packages.

Additional definition for common arguments 
=========================================== 

To better construct a good API, an explanation of some arguments is useful 
to let the user aware when meeting such argument as a type variable in fromt 
a callable function sperated by a colon. 

**erp** : Stand for Electrical Resistivity Profiling. Typically, the type hint 
    for |ERP| is ``Array[float, DType [float]]`` or ``List[float]``. Its
    array is supposed to hold the apparent resistivy values  collected 
    during the survey. 
    
**p**: Typically mean position but by preference means station location
    positions. The type hint used to defined the `p` is ``
    ``Array[int, DType [int]]`` or ``List[int]``. Indeed, the position 
    supposed to be on integer array and the given values enven in float 
    should be casted to integers. 
     
**cz**: Stands for Conductive Zone. It is a subset of |ERP| so they share the 
    same type hint. However, for better demarcation, ``Sub`` is convenient to 
    use to avoid any confusion about the full |ERP| and the extracted  
    conductive as demontrated in the example above in ``Sub`` type hint
    definition.
