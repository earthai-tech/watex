v0.3.0 (November 21, 2023)
--------------------------

These are substantial changes in ``v0.2.7`` API that lead to new features and fugs fixed. 
 
- |API change| ``watex.methods.em.Processing`` and ``watex.methods.em.ZC`` do no longer exist. 
  They have been changed to :class:`watex.methods.em.EMAP` and 
  :class:`watex.methods.em.MT` respectively.

- |API change| ``watex.utils.funcutils.fit_by_ll`` is deprecated and replaced by :func:`watex.utils.funcutils.fit_ll`. 

- |Fix| Bug in removing the static shift in :term:`AMT` data. Henceforth the correction factor method deprecated method ``watex.methods.em.ZC.get_ss_correction_factors``
  replaced by :meth:`watex.methods.em.MT.get_ss_correction_factors` is applied for each station differently rather than using 
  the factor to correct all stations. There are also a  choice for user to input the correction factors ``ss_fx`` and ``ss_fy`` manually into a list. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.plotutils.plot_tensors` plots resistivity and phase tensors or the real and imaginary impedance.

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.torres_verdin_filter` calculates the adaptive moving average of a given data array from 
  Torres and Verdin codes 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.methods.em.filter_noises` remove noise from component ``xx``, ``yy``, ``xy`` or ``yx``. 

- |Feature| :meth:`watex.methods.em.MT.remove_noises` removes artifacts in the data and smooth it. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.methods.em.drop_frequencies` drop bad frequencies or frequencies with no consistent data in the EDI files. 

- |Feature| :func:`watex.utils.plotutils.plot_sounding` plot the vertical electrical resistivity data. 

- |Enhancement| :func:`watex.utils.plot_profiling` accepts `ax` as a paramater. 

- |Enhancement| :func:`watex.view.TPlot.plot_rhophi` changes the style of plot in preceeding versions. It accepts parameter `kind` for plotting multiple stations differently.  

- |Enhancement| Fix overlapping xlabels in the :func:`watex.utils.exmath.plotOhmicArea`.
