v0.3.2 (March 9, 2024)
-----------------------

Minor changes have been made to the API since version ``v0.3.1``, leading
to fixed bugs in frequencies handling.

- |Fix| Fixed the bound error in :meth:`~watex.methods.MT.remove_static_shift` by
  rounding the frequency checks to 5 decimal places.

- |Fix| There is no longer a need to recompute frequencies when no extraneous
  frequencies are detected for omission. :meth:`~watex.methods.MT.drop_frequencies`
  now consistently returns the original :term:`MT` object.
